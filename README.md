# Serialization and Deserialization


## Introduction

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process, where the byte stream is converted back into a copy of the original object. These processes are crucial for various applications, including data storage, communication between different parts of a system, and enabling persistence.







## Benefits

- Data Persistence: Serialization allows objects to be saved to a file or a database, making it possible to restore the state of an application after a restart.

- Communication: In distributed systems, serialization is used to send objects over a network. This is common in remote procedure calls (RPC) and web services.

- Performance: Serialized data can be efficiently transmitted and stored, reducing the overhead compared to other data formats.

- Interoperability: Different systems or programming languages can communicate with each other using common serialization formats like JSON, XML, or Protocol Buffers.

## Mechanism

Serialization and deserialization involve converting complex objects into simpler forms that can be easily stored and transmitted. Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how these processes work in Java:

- ## Serialization:
- Implement the Serializable interface in the class.
- Use ObjectOutputStream to write the object to an output stream.

- ## Deserialization:
- Use ObjectInputStream to read the object from an input stream.
- Cast the read object back to its original type.
